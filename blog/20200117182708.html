<h3>Let's encrypt requires a web server to obtain a certificate</h3>
<p>
  Let's encrypt issues SSL certificates by verifying that you have access to a web server with an HTTP connection.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, you need a web server to listen for HTTP connections.
</p>
<p>
  Install <a href="/blog/20200115175810.html">Aapche</a> as your web server.
</p>
<p>
  For HTTPS connection, mod_ssl is required, so install <a href="/blog/20200112182708.html">mod_ssl</a>.
</p>
<p>
  As a common server configuration, let's consider the case where a reverse proxy is used to listen.
</p>
<p>
  Set up the following in /etc/httpd/conf.d/vhost.conf to receive "www.mydomain.example" on the default port 80 of HTTP, and then on port 10000 of the application server behind it.
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;VirtualHost *:80
    ServerName www.mydomain.example
    
    &lt;Proxy *&gt;
      Require all granted
    &lt;/Proxy

    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    ProxyPass / http://localhost:10000/ keepalive=On
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:10000/
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
  &lt;/VirtualHost
</pre>
<p>
  We will not configure the settings for loading the SSL certificate at this point, as it does not exist.
</p>
<p>
  After configuring the settings, <a href="/blog/20200115175810.html">restart Apache</a> and go to "http://www.mydomain.example" and make sure you can connect. Before restarting, it is a good idea to <a href="/blog/20200114175810.html">check</a> that the Apache configuration file is correct.
</p>
<p>
  Here is a simple example of starting a server with Mojolicious, which is a reverse proxy and connects to a web application.
</p>
<pre>
# myapp.pl
use Mojolicious::Lite;

app-&gt;start;
</pre>
<p>
  Launch
</p>
<pre>
hypnotoad myapp.pl
</pre>
<p>
  The default port for the <a href="https://en.webapp.perlzemi.com/">Mojolicious</a> hypnotoad server is 10000, but if you want to specify the port number, edit "hypnotoad.conf".
</p>
<h3>Obtain an SSL certificate</h3>
<p>
  Let's use certbot to get an SSL certificate, and it will automatically add the configuration for HTTPS connection for Apache.
</p>
<pre>
sudo certbot run --apache -d www.mydomain.example
</pre>
